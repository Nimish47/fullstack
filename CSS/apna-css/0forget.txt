1. absolute/fixed VS sticky -> sticky should be used for navbars and footers
2. disadvantage of abvsolute - see 8position.html
3. sticky - the position of lement with position: sticky is really important in html code,
            preferrably put navbaars at start of html code and footers at bottom of html code
4. when not to use sticky and use fixed => 11sticky.html & id=article            
3. disadvantage of fixed - scorlls but overlaps some content - see 9fixed.html
4. dont use vw and vh
5. dont use rem
6. very important => 
    body {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
    }
7. width: 100% very important
8. sticky and z-index => 8position.html
9. background-repeat: no-repeat; => use this for no repitition on x and y axes
10. for background-image: cover to properly work, use high quality images.
11. when designing css grids - prepare sketch + add grid props to individual divs one by one and refresh UI after
    every change. Not every div needs grid-row AND grid-colun both.
12. Grid area constraint - individual areas should form a rectangle
