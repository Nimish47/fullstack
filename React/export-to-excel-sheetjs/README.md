# TOPIC ALL ABOUT SHEET JS
# 1. READ FROM A DATA-TYPE AND EXPORT TO FILE
# 2. READ FROM A FILE AND STORE TO DATA-TYPE
# PERFORM ABOVE TWO TASKS ASYNCHRONOUSLY (NON-BLOCKING)


# WRITE TO A FILE
# we READ data from below data-types
    1. json data
# we EXPORT data-read to below file-types:
    1. excel
    2. csv

# READ FROM A FILE
# we IMPORT data from below file-types:
    1. excel

# OTHER CONCEPTS
# export multiple sheets in single workbook
# export custom feilds to file (from input data)
# read data from multiple sheets in excel    
# generate Excel File in Browser (blob, without download)
# apply custom styles
# XLSX.write vs XLSX.writeFile in SheetJS
# file-saver library to download a file
# differentiate b/w downloading via blob v/s download via library fn directly.


# ASYNC READ AND WRITE
# READ from large excel file asynchronously
# WRITE to excel file (from large input data-set) (downloadable)
# WRITE to excel file as a blob (not downloadabale)
# WRITE to excel file and sent it to server (without downloading)
