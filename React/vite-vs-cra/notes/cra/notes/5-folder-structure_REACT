TITLE # all info about files created during intial create-react-app setup

Importtant files and folders created during react App initialization using creat-react-app:

Files and Folder rules for build to be successful:
    1. These files must exist with exact filenames:
            public/index.html is the page template
            src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.
            You can delete or rename the other files (but not above two)

    2. For faster rebuilds, only files inside src are processed by webpack.
       You need to put any JS and CSS files inside src, otherwise webpack wonâ€™t see them. 

    3. Only files inside public can be used from public/index.html.

    4. If you have Git installed and your project is not part of a larger repository,
       then a new repository will be initialized resulting in an additional top-level .git directory.
