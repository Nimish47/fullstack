browserlist:
    - browserslist is a configuration section in package.json that defines which browsers your project
      should support.
    - It helps tools like Babel, Autoprefixer, and ESLint optimize JavaScript and CSS based on the
      specified browser targets.     

                "browserslist": {
                    "production": [
                        ">0.2%",
                        "not dead",
                        "not op_mini all"
                    ],
                    "development": [
                        "last 1 chrome version",
                        "last 1 firefox version",
                        "last 1 safari version"
                    ]
                }     
    - ">0.2%":                  Supports browsers with >0.2% market share
    - not dead:                 Excludes browsers that haven't had updates for >24 months
    - last 1 chrome version:    support only the latest version of Chrome
    - IE 11:                    Specifically supports Internet Explorer 11
    - not op_mini all:          excludes Opera Mini from the supported browser list 
                                    ✅ Opera Mini runs in "Extreme" mode, which means it doesn't support
                                        many modern web features.
                                    ✅ Most JavaScript is disabled, and pages are heavily compressed on Opera's
                                        servers.
                                    ✅ Very low usage globally (~0.1% market share).
