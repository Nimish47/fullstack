// Definition:
Web Vitals is an initiative by Google to measure and improve the user experience on the web.
These metrics help developers understand how fast, stable, and responsive their websites are.

📊 Core Web Vitals (Key Metrics)
Google focuses on three main Core Web Vitals, which impact SEO rankings and user experience:

1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) – Loading Performance ⏳
    ✅ Measures how long it takes for the largest visible content (e.g., an image or text block) to load.
    ✅ Ideal LCP: ≤ 2.5 seconds
    ✅ Issues: Slow server response, render-blocking resources, large images

2. First Input Delay (FID) – Interactivity 🖱️
    ✅ Measures how quickly a page responds to the first user interaction (e.g., clicking a button or link).
    ✅ Ideal FID: ≤ 100ms
    ✅ Issues: Heavy JavaScript execution, long tasks blocking the main thread

3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) – Visual Stability 🎯
    ✅ Measures how much the page layout shifts unexpectedly while loading.
    ✅ Ideal CLS: ≤ 0.1
    ✅ Issues: Images or ads without dimensions, dynamically injected content

🚀 How to Measure Web Vitals?
You can check Web Vitals using:
    🔹 Google PageSpeed Insights → https://pagespeed.web.dev/
    🔹 Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools) → F12 → "Lighthouse" tab
    🔹 Google Search Console → "Core Web Vitals" report
    🔹 Web Vitals JavaScript Library → npm install web-vitals

🔧 How to Improve Web Vitals?
    ✅ Optimize images → Use WebP, lazy loading, and compression
    ✅ Reduce JavaScript execution time → Minimize and defer JavaScript
    ✅ Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) → Serve static assets faster
    ✅ Eliminate render-blocking resources → Minify CSS & JavaScript
    ✅ Specify image & ad dimensions → Prevent layout shifts
